\title{L1centrality: Graph/Network Analysis Based on \out{<i>L</i><sub>1</sub>}
Centrality}
\description{
Analyze graph/network data using \out{<i>L</i><sub>1</sub>} centrality and
prestige. Functions for deriving global and local \out{<i>L</i><sub>1</sub>}
centrality/prestige and \out{<i>L</i><sub>1</sub>} centrality/prestige-based
neighborhoods of vertices are provided. Routines for visual inspection of a
graph/network are also provided. Details are in Kang and Oh (2024a,b).
}
\details{
Every function inside this package supports a distinct variety of graphs.
Edge weights can be considered by all functions. Additionally, it is
assumed that the graph to be analyzed is a connected graph in the case of an
undirected graph, or a strongly connected graph in the case of a directed
graph.

Certain functions exclusively accommodate undirected graphs without vertex
multiplicity, while others support both directed and
undirected graphs with vertex multiplicities. The following table provides a
concise overview of the support range for each function.
