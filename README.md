Graph/Network Analysis Based on L1 Centrality

## What is *L*<sub>1</sub> centrality?

*L*<sub>1</sub> centrality is a new centrality measure that assesses the
prominence of vertices in an undirected and connected graph (Kang and
Oh, 2024a). It properly handles graphs that have weights assigned to
both vertices and edges. Based on this centrality measure, several
graphical and multiscale analysis tools are developed.

There are analogous measures for strongly connected directed graphs: the
*L*<sub>1</sub> centrality and *L*<sub>1</sub> prestige (Kang and Oh,
2024b). The former one quantifies the prominence of vertices in *giving*
choices, while the latter evaluates the prominence in *receiving*
choices. Multiscale analysis tools are developed from these measures as
well.

## How can I get L1centrality?

Version 0.0.3 of this package is available on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=L1centrality):

``` r
install.packages("L1centrality")
library(L1centrality)
```

You can install the development version (0.0.3.9002) of `L1centrality`
via:

``` r
devtools::install_github("seungwoo-stat/L1centrality")
library(L1centrality)
```

## How do I use it?

Using the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie network (undirected, connected
graph) and *L*<sub>1</sub> centrality function `L1cent()` provided via
this package, we can identify movies with high *L*<sub>1</sub>
centrality, i.e., movies that are central in the given network.

``` r
library(L1centrality)
L1cent(MCUmovie) |> 
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) |> 
  head()
#>  Avengers: Infinity War       Avengers: Endgame            The Avengers 
#>               1.0000000               0.6939885               0.5269421 
#>              Iron Man 2 Avengers: Age of Ultron  Spider-Man: Homecoming 
#>               0.4113450               0.3865311               0.3691427
```

There are other useful functions built upon the *L*<sub>1</sub>
centrality and *L*<sub>1</sub> prestige measures: `L1centMDS()` (target
plot), `L1centNB()` (*L*<sub>1</sub> centrality-based neighborhood),
`L1centLOC()` (local *L*<sub>1</sub> centrality), `L1centEDGE()`
(multiscale edge representation), and `Lorenz_plot()` (group
heterogeneity plot and index).

Refer to the package documentation for an overview of the support range
for each function.

``` r
?`L1centrality-package`
```

Moreover, two undirected and connected network data are provided:
`MCUmovie` (Marvel Cinematic Universe movie network) and `rokassembly21`
(Republic of Koreaâ€™s 21st National Assembly bill cosponsorship network).
See the document for further details.
